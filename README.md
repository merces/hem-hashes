# Hashes

[Hiew](https://hiew.io) External Module (HEM) to calculate MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 hashes of files and blocks.

## Installation

Download the `.hem` file and put it in your HIEW `hem` folder.

## Usage

After opening a file in Hiew, press `F11` to load a HIEW module and choose it from the menu.
It will calculate common hashes of the whole file. If you mark a block instead, Hashes will generate
the hashes of the block content. Press `F5` to copy a hash value to clipboard.

my own bugs :cowboy_hat_face:).
- SEN for Hiew.
